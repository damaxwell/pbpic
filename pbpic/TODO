Font metrics for "Courier New" are broken.  Is this a font matrix issue?
They look like they are 1000 times more than they ought to be.

Courier and "Courier Bold" seem to be transposed; reading from a dfont.

draw should ensure only path ops happen

rotations should be in circle fractions by default.

verify currentpoint before show and whereverelse

who is in charge of ensuring copies are made for a gstate: the canvas
or the gstate? My guess is that if you have the convention that a
'set' is always given a copy, then you can copy gstates cheaply.

big buildup of initial gstate parameters at the start of an inset.  Fix this.

INITIALIZE GSTATE in the renderer!!!!!

Why am I keeping track of last operation in render_pdf

Done: (dashes are always in pen coordinates) dashes in proper coordinates (i.e. lengths?).

scaleto:  should rescale the coordinate system so that every unit vector
in user coordinates has length given by Length in the Length's coordinate system, and such that the current dx is preserved, and such that the 
current origin is preserved.

Done: setlinewidth: should set things up so that lines are drawn in the Length's coordinate system

Done: setfontsize: What should I do for a Length?

Done: How do you specify the page size?  Right now you can give w/h in __init__ or w/h/extents in begin.  Why specify in init? How do these two mechanisms get along?
Answer: For now page size set only in __init__, never in begin.  At least its in just one place this way.

Vertical metrics for true type fonts

Path cache should either not store a relative path or code getting a path from the cache should verify the file exists (and if not, try for real)

Done: cache DVIs

Done: TrueType collections

Done: should paths be stored in feature or page coordinates?  PAGE
